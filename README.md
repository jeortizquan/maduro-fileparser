# Madurobank Customer Statement Processor
Madurobank receives monthly deliveries of customer statement records. This information is delivered in two formats, CSV and XML. These records of the 2 files need to be validated.

## Input
The format of the file is a simplified version of the MT940 format. The format is as follows:

## Table 1. Record description
| Field | Description |
| ---   | --- |
| Transaction reference | A numeric value |
| Account number  | An IBAN
|Start Balance | The starting balance in Euros |
| Mutation | Either an addition (+) or a deduction (-) |
| Description | Free text |
|End Balance | The end balance in Euros |

## Output
There are two validations:

* all transaction references should be unique
* the end balance needs to be validated

At the end of the processing, a report needs to be created which will display both the transaction reference 
and description of each of the failed records.
